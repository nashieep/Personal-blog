        <p>Afrobeat is a Nigerian music genre that involves the combination of West African musical styles and American funk, jazz, and soul influences, with a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Why Afro beats?</h2>
        <h5>Afrobeat, as a musical genre, pioneered the inclusivity of the Africans in the diaspora</h5>

        <p>Afrobeats is jubilant party music that draws on West African sources — hybrid languages, propulsive rhythms.</p>
        <p>The newest popular musical style among today's youth is afro beats. I recall, though, falling in love with the first song I heard before it became popular. I felt the impulse to stand up and "dance" to let my body speak for itself. I eventually began dating a Nigerian who introduced me to more music, and I haven't looked back since.</p>
