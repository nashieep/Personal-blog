    <p>My name is Nash, and I was born in Haiti. After moving to the US in 2013, I now call Texas home. At the moment, Udacity is where I am learning web development. I enjoy taking images of random objects and nature while listening to music.

    <p>Afrobeat is a Nigerian music genre that involves the combination of West African musical styles and American funk, jazz, and soul influences, with a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion.</p>

    <h2> Why Afro beats?
    </h2>
    <h5>Afrobeat, as a musical genre, pioneered the inclusivity of the Africans in the diaspora</h5>

    <p>Afrobeats is jubilant party music that draws on West African sources — hybrid languages, propulsive rhythms.</p>
    <p>The newest popular musical style among today's youth is afro beats. I recall, though, falling in love with the first song I heard before it became popular. I felt the impulse to stand up and "dance" to let my body speak for itself. I eventually began dating a Nigerian who introduced me to more music, and I haven't looked back since.</p>
